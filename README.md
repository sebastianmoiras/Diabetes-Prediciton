# Diabetes Prediction using Neural Networks

## Project Description
This project implements a **neural network model** to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes.  
The goal is to showcase the application of **deep learning in healthcare**, turning structured patient data into actionable predictions that can assist in early detection and prevention.
