## Project Description
This project implements a **neural network model** to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes.  
The goal is to showcase the application of **deep learning in healthcare**, turning structured patient data into actionable predictions that can assist in early detection and prevention.  

In addition, the project compares the performance of two Keras modeling approaches:  
- **Sequential API** – a straightforward, layer-by-layer model.  
- **Functional API** – a more flexible approach that allows complex architectures (e.g., skip connections, multi-input).  

The comparison highlights how architecture choices can affect model accuracy, generalization, and training efficiency.
